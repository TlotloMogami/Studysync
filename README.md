## How It Works

1. Students enter their weekly class timetable and planned study sessions.
2. Add personal activities such as meetings or social events.
3. Use natural language commands like:
   - "Cancel all plans from 2pm to 4pm today."
   - "Move my study session tomorrow from 10am to 12pm."
   - "Add a break at 3pm."
4. The AI parses commands and updates the schedule in real-time.
